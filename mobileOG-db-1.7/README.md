## currently for dev purposes. 

We are working on an updated release of mobileOG-db which will include a deep learning model for protein prediction. 

As part of this, we changed the element labeling system so that each protein will have only one classification label. The new ones are: 

1. Phage
2. Plasmid
3. Recombinase
4. Conjugative element
5. Chromosome, hitcher, accessory, or unknown.
